In Task 4, I focused on the comprehensive analysis and visualization of Fintech app user reviews from multiple banks to derive actionable insights through sentiment and thematic analysis.

Key Steps and Achievements:

    Data Aggregation & Cleaning:
    Utilized the sentiment_analysis_results.csv file containing review texts, ratings, dates, banks, and sentiment labels and scores (vader_label, vader_score) to prepare clean datasets for analysis.

    Sentiment Distribution Analysis:
    Aggregated sentiment counts (positive, neutral, negative) per bank to understand overall user sentiment. This distribution was visualized using stacked bar charts, showing the volume of each sentiment category per bank.

    Thematic Analysis:
    Examined thematic_analysis_results.csv to identify prevalent themes in user feedback across banks. Created bar plots for theme frequency per bank to highlight common topics of concern or appreciation.

    Trend and Rating Correlations:
    Analyzed sentiment trends over time by bank, resampling data monthly to capture temporal changes in user opinion. Also explored the relationship between app ratings and sentiment scores on a per-bank basis.

    Word Cloud Visualization:
    Generated word clouds from negative review texts to visually emphasize the most frequent terms contributing to dissatisfaction, helping identify potential areas for improvement.

    Jupyter Notebook Integration:
    All plots, including sentiment distributions, thematic frequencies, sentiment trends, rating vs. sentiment correlations, and word clouds, were embedded directly in the Jupyter notebook for immediate interactive analysis and review.

    File Management:
    Ensured all output plots are systematically saved in the task4/plots directory for easy access and further reporting.
